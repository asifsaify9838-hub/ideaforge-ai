# IdeaForge AI (Demo)

This is a demo project scaffold for "IdeaForge AI". The API endpoints return mock responses so you can run and test locally (using `vercel dev`) or deploy to Vercel.

Folders:
- public/       -> static frontend (index.html + assets)
- api/generate/ -> serverless endpoints for script, voice, scene, music, video
- api/status.js -> simple health check

Replace placeholder assets in `public/assets/` with real images. Implement real AI integrations in the API handlers (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Runway, etc.) if you want production behavior.
